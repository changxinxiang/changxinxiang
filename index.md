## Short introduction
I am now an undergraduate in Nanjing University, Business School. I major in economics, so I utilize methods like econometrics, structural equation model and game theory, programming of Stata and Python. Also I'm learning some application of machine learning and text analysis. I've done several jobs about RA and paper coperation, work like data collection and cleaning, text analysis and empirical design; fields like green banking research in CEOs' view, environmental performance and factors of Chinese MNEs.
